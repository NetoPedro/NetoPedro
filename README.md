## Who is Pedro? 

I'm a Machine Learning Researcher at INESC TEC in Portugal working on explainable artificial intelligence for computer vision problems, such as face biometrics and digital pathology. I am also finishing my PhD in "Explainable Artificial Intelligence for (Face) Biometrics". In parallel I have led as PI a project on this topic, conducted research on colorectal cancer diagnosis from WSI (with industry partners) and taught ML to PhD students at FEUP, Portugal. 


You can find my contributions to science by topic:

1. PIC (TODO)
2. BIAS (TODO)
3. MFR (TODO)
4. Morphing (TODO)

**Digital Pathology**
1. Dataset (TODO)
2. Annotation Guidelines (TODO)
2. Three Weakly Supervised Approaches (TODO)
3. A working platform for the diagnosis (TODO)

**Others**
1. Push-up counter for a hackathon
