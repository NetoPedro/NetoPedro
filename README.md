## Who is Pedro C. Neto? 

I'm a Machine Learning Researcher at INESC TEC in Portugal working on explainable artificial intelligence for computer vision problems, such as face biometrics and digital pathology. I am also finishing my PhD in "Explainable Artificial Intelligence for (Face) Biometrics". In parallel I have led as PI a project on this topic, conducted research on colorectal cancer diagnosis from WSI (with industry partners) and taught ML to PhD students at FEUP, Portugal.
