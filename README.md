## Who is Pedro C. Neto? 

I'm a Artificial Intelligence Scientis at Unilabs in Portugal working on medical artificial intelligence. While confidential, my work will be directed to several image-based use cases at Unilabs. 

My past work focused on computer vision problems, such as face biometrics and digital pathology. I am also finishing my PhD in "Explainable Artificial Intelligence for (Face) Biometrics". In parallel I have led as PI a project on this topic, conducted research on colorectal cancer diagnosis from WSI (with industry partners) and delivered lectures and practical sessions of ML to PhD students at FEUP, Portugal.
